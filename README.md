For this assignment a profestional portfolio was created to showcase all current and future projects. I am having a hard time with my positiong and making the webpage responsive. I was able to make the page responsive for the about me section, but I can't get it to work for the rest as I still need further tutoring sessions.
Although this does not look complete, I am working with Alexa Stefankiewicz to understand how to make a webpage responsive and will continue to work obn this webpage.
